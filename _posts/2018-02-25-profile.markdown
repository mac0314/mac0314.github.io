A student developer majoring in computer science which changed its name to ‘software’.
I am interested in Internet of Things(IoT), Artificial intelligence(AI) and Blockchain.
I have experienced in developing web, android, server etc. And I also have a little knowledge about hardware.
Furthermore, I am interested in startup companies. Thus I participated in making a startup ‘보기 드문 젊은이’ as a co-founder and SW developer. And then I worked for a researcher in ETRI and MMCN Lab and a developer in Blocko and KoSAC.
